## Overview

I've completed the challenge after many research about the Flexbox and CSS custom properties. I did my best and that's all that matters

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

My skills with HTML and CSS are improving thanks to this challenge. I'd say it was quite difficult to build this at first but in the end, I finished it.
